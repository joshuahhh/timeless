        <p>
          Suppose that I am try­ing to make a table for the black­birds in
          my gar­den. In<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>in­ter,<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>hen the snow is<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>n the ground,
          and the black­birds are short<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f food, I<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ill put food
          <span class="pull-o">o</span>ut for them<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>n the table. So I build the table; and
          dream about the<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>lus­ters<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f black­birds<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>hich<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ill<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>ome
          flock­ing to the table in the snow.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is not so easy to build a table that<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ill re­ally<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ork.
          <span class="pull-T">T</span>he birds fol­low their<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>wn laws; and if I don’t un­der­stand
          them, they just<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>on’t<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>ome. If I put the table too
          low, the birds<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>on’t fly down to it, be­cause they don’t
          like to swoop too<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>lose to the ground. If it is too
          high in the air,<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>r too ex­posed, the<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ind<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>on’t let
          them set­tle<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>n it. If it is near a laun­dry line, blow­ing
          in the<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ind, they<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ill be fright­ened by the mov­ing
          line. Most<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f the places<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>here I put the table ac­tu­ally
          don’t<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ork.
        </p>
        <p>
          I slowly learn that black­birds have a mil­lion sub­tle forces guid­ing
          them in their be­hav­ior. If I don’t un­der­stand these
          forces, there is sim­ply noth­ing I<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>an do to make the
          table<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>ome to life. So long as the plac­ing<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f the table
          is in­ex­act, my im­age<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f the black­birds flocked around
          the table eat­ing, is just<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ish­ful think­ing.<span class="push-T"></span> <span class="pull-T">T</span>o make
          the table live, I must take these forces se­ri­ously,
          and place the table in a po­si­tion<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>hich is per­fectly
          ex­act.
