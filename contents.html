          There is one timeless way of building.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is thousands of years old, and the same today as it has always
          been.
        </p>
        <p>
          The great traditional buildings of the past, the villages and
          tents and temples in which man feels at home, have
          always been made by people who were very close to the
          center of this way. It is not possible to make great
          buildings, or great towns, beautiful places, places
          where you feel yourself, places where you feel alive,
          except by following this way. And, as you will see,
          this way will lead anyone who looks for it to buildings
          which are themselves as ancient in their form, as the
          trees and hills, and as our faces are.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          It is a process through which the order of a building or a town
          grows out directly from the inner nature of the people,
          and the animals, and plants, and matter which are in
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a process which allows the life inside a person, or a family,
          or a town, to flourish, openly, in freedom, so vividly
          that it gives birth, of its own accord, to the natural
          order which is needed to sustain this life.

          It is so powerful and fundamental that with its help you can
          make any building in the world as beautiful as any
          place that you have ever seen.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          Once you understand this way, you will be able to make your room
          alive; you will be able to design a house together
          with your family; a garden for your children; places
          where you can work; beautiful terraces where you can
          sit and dream.

          It is so powerful, that with its help hundreds of people together
          can create a town, which is alive and vibrant, peaceful
          and relaxed, a town as beautiful as any town in history.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          Without the help of architects or planners, if you are working
          in the timeless way, a town will grow under your hands,
          as steady as the flowers in your garden.

          This does not mean that all ways of making buildings are identical.
          It means that at the core of all successful acts of
          building and at the core of all successful processes
          of growth, even though there are a million different
          versions of these acts and processes, there is one
          fundamental invariant feature, which is responsible
          for their success. Although this way has taken on a
          thousand different forms at different times, in different
          places, still, there is an unavoidable, invariant core
          to all of them.

          And the Alhambra, some tiny gothic church, an old New England
          house, an Alpine hill village, an ancient Zen temple,
          a seat by a mountain stream, a courtyard filled with
          blue and yellow tiles among the earth. What is it they
          have in common? They are beautiful, ordered, harmonious—yes,
          all these things. But especially, and what strikes

          It is a fundamental human instinct, as much a part of our desire
          as the desire for children. It is, quite simply, the
          desire to make a part of nature, to complete a world
          which is already made of mountains, streams, snowdrops,
          and stones, with something made by us, as much a part
          of nature, and a part of our immediate surroundings.

          Each one of us has, somewhere in his heart the dream to make
          a living world a universe.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          Those of us who have been trained as architects have this desire
          perhaps at the very center of our lives: that one day,
          somewhere, somehow, we shall build one building which
          is wonderful, beautiful, breathtaking, a place where
          people can walk and dream for centuries.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some form, every person has some version of this dream: whoever
          you are, you may have the dream of one day building
          a most beautiful house for your family, a garden, a
          fountain, a fishpond, a big room with soft light, flowers
          outside and the smell of new grass.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some less clear fashion, anyone who is concerned with towns
          has this same dream, perhaps, for an entire town.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="unit">
      <div class="unit-headline">
        <p>
          And there is a way that a building or a town can actually be
          brought to life like this.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          There is a definable sequence of activities which are at the
          heart of all acts of building, and it is possible to
          specify, precisely, under what conditions these activities
          will generate a building which is alive. All this can
          be made so explicit that anyone can do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And just so, the process by which a group of independent people
          make part of a town alive can equally be made precise.
          Again, there is a definable sequence of activities,
          more complex in this case, which are at the heart of
          all collective building processes, and it is possible
          to specify exactly when these processes will bring
          things to life. And, once again, these processes can
          be made so explicit, and so clear, that any group of
          people can make use of them.

          This one way of building has always existed.

      <div class="unit-details">

          It is behind the building of traditional villages in Africa,
          and India, and Japan. It was behind the building of
          the great religious buildings: the mosques of Islam,
          the monasteries of the middle ages, and the temples
          of Japan. It was behind the building of the simple
          benches, and cloisters and arcades of English country
          towns; of the mountain huts of Norway and Austria;
          the roof tiles on the walls of castles and palaces;
          the bridges of the Italian middle ages; the cathedral
          of Pisa.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an unconscious form, this way has been behind almost all ways
          of building for thousands of years.

    </div>
    <div class="unit">
      <div class="unit-headline">
        <p>
          But it has become possible to identify it, only now, by going
          to a level of analysis which is deep enough to show
          what is invariant in all the different versions of
          this way.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          This hinges on a form of representation which reveals all possible
          construction processes, as versions of one deeper process.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we have a way of looking at the ultimate constituents
          of the environment: the ultimate "things" which a building
          or a town is made of. As we shall see, in chapters
          4 and 5, every building, every town, is made of certain
          entities which I call patterns: and once we understand
          buildings in terms of their patterns, we have a way
          of looking at them, which makes all buildings, all
          parts of a town similar, all members of the same class
          of physical structures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, we have a way of understanding the generative processes
          which give rise to these patterns: in short, the source
          from which the ultimate constituents of building come.
          As we shall see in chapters 10, 11, and 12, these patterns
          always come from certain combinatory processes, which
          are different in the specific patterns which they generate,
          but always similar in their overall structure, and
          in the way they work. They are essentially like languages.
          And again, in terms of these pattern languages, all
          the different ways of building, although different
          in detail, become similar in general outline.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="unit">
      <div class="unit-headline">
        <p>
          At this level of analysis, we can compare many different building
          processes.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          Then, once we see their differences clearly, it becomes possible
          to define the difference between those processes which
          make buildings live, and those which make them dead.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="unit">
      <div class="unit-headline">
        <p>
          And it turns out that, invariant, behind all processes which
          allow us to make buildings live, there is a single
          common process.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          This single process is operational and precise. It is not merely
          a vague idea, or a class of processes which we can
          understand: it is concrete enough and specific enough,
          so that it functions practically. It gives us the power
          to make towns and buildings live, as concretely as
          a match gives us the power to make a flame. It is a
          method or a discipline, which teaches us precisely
          what we have to do to make our buildings live.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="unit">
      <div class="unit-headline">
        <p>
          But though this method is precise, it cannot be used mechanically.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          The fact is, that even when we have seen deep into the processes
          by which it is possible to make a building or a town
          alive, in the end, it turns out that this knowledge
          only brings us back to that part of ourselves which
          is forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the process is precise, and can be defined in exact
          scientific terms, finally it becomes valuable, not
          so much because it shows us things which we don't know,
          but instead, because it shows us what we know already,
          only daren't admit because it seems so childish, and
          so primitive.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="unit">
      <div class="unit-headline">
        <p>
          Indeed it turns out, in the end, that what this method does is
          simply free us from all method.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          The more we learn to use this method, the more we find that what
          it does is not so much to teach us processes we did
          not know before, but rather opens up a process in us,
          which was part of us already.
        </p>
        <p>
          We find out that we already know how to make buildings live,
          but that the power has been frozen in us: that we have
          it, but are afraid to use it: that we are crippled
          by our fears; and crippled by the methods and the images
          which we use to overcome these fears.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what happens finally, is that we learn to overcome our fears,
          and reach that portion of our selves which knows exactly
          how to make a building live, instinctively. But we
          learn too, that this capacity in us is not accessible,
          until we first go through the discipline which teaches
          us to let go of our fears.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="unit">
      <div class="unit-headline">

          And that is why the timeless way is, in the end, a timeless one.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          It is not an external method, which can be imposed on things.
          It is instead a process which lies deep in us: and
          only needs to be released.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="unit">
      <div class="unit-headline">
        <p>
          The power to make buildings beautiful lies in each of us already.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          It is a core so simple, and so deep, that we are born with it.
          This is no metaphor. I mean it literally. Imagine the
          greatest possible beauty and harmony in the world—the
          most beautiful place that you have ever seen or dreamt
          of. You have the power to create it, at this very moment,
          just as you are.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this power we have is so firmly rooted and coherent in every
          one of us that once it is liberated, it will allow
          us, by our individual, unconnected acts, to make a
          town, without the slightest need for plans, because,
          like every living process, it is a process which builds
          order out of nothing.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="unit">
      <div class="unit-headline">
        <p>
          But as things are, we have so far beset ourselves with rules,
          and concepts, and ideas of what must be done to make
          a building or a town alive, that we have become afraid
          of what will happen naturally, and convinced that we
          must work within a "system" and with "methods" since
          without them our surroundings will come tumbling down
          in chaos.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          We are afraid, perhaps, that without images and methods, chaos
          will break loose; worse still, that unless we use images
          of some kind, ourselves, our own creation will itself
          be chaos. And why are we afraid of that? Is it because
          people will laugh at us, if we make chaos? Or is it,
          perhaps, that we are most afraid of all that if we
          do make chaos, when we hope to create art, we will
          ourselves be chaos, hollow, nothing?
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why it is so easy for others to play on our fears. They
          can persuade us that we must have more method, and
          more system, because we are afraid of our own chaos.
          Without method and more method, we are afraid the chaos
          which is in us will reveal itself. And yet these methods
          only make things worse.

          The thoughts and fears which feed these methods are illusions.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          It is the fears which these illusions have created in us, that
          make places which are dead and lifeless and artificial.
          And&mdash;greatest irony of all&mdash;it is the very
          methods we invent to free us from our fears which are
          themselves the chains whose grip on us creates our
          difficulties.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the fact is, that this seeming chaos which is in us is a
          rich, rolling, swelling, dying, lilting, singing, laughing,
          shouting, crying, sleeping <i>order</i>.
          If we will only let this order guide our acts of building,
          the buildings that we make, the towns we help to make,
          will be the forests and the meadows of the human heart.

          To purge ourselves of these illusions, to become free of all
          the artificial images of order which distort the nature
          that is in us, we must first learn a discipline which
          teaches us the true relationship between ourselves
          and our surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, once this discipline has done its work, and pricked the
          bubbles of illusion which we cling to now, we will
          be ready to give up the discipline, and act as nature
          does.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the timeless way of building: learning the discipline&mdash;and
          shedding it.

      The quality without a name

    <div class="chapter-headline">
      There is a central quality which is the root criterion of life
      and spirit in a man, a town, a building, or a wilderness.
      This quality is objective and precise but it cannot be
      named.

          We have been taught that there is no objective difference between
          good buildings and bad, good towns and bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact is that the difference between a good building and a
          bad building, between a good town and a bad town, is
          an objective matter. It is the difference between health
          and sickness, wholeness and dividedness, self-maintenance
          and self-destruction. In a world which is healthy,
          whole, alive, and self-maintaining, people themselves
          can be alive and self-creating. In a world which is
          unwhole and self-destroying, people cannot be alive:
          they will inevitably themselves be self-destroying,
          and miserable.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is easy to understand why people believe so firmly that
          there is no single, solid basis for the difference
          between good building and bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          It happens because the single central quality which makes the
          difference cannot be named.

          The first place I think of, when I try to tell someone about
          this quality, is a corner of an English country garden,
          where a peach tree grows against a wall.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wall runs east to west; the peach tree grows flat against
          its southern side. The sun shines on the tree and as
          it warms the bricks behind the tree, the warm bricks
          themselves warm the peaches on the tree. It has a slightly
          dozy quality. The tree, carefully tied to grow flat
          against the wall; warming the bricks; the peaches growing
          in the sun; the wild grass growing around the roots
          of the tree, in the angle where the earth and roots
          and wall all meet.
        </p>
        <p>
          This quality is the most fundamental quality there is in anything.

          It is never twice the same because it always takes its shape

          it is light j in another it is dark; in one room it
          is soft and quiet; in another it is 'yellow. In one
          family it is a love of picnics; in another dancing;
          in another playing poker; in another group of people
          it is not family life at all.

          A system has this quality when it is at one with itself; it lacks
          it when it is divided.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has it when it is true to its own inner forces; lacks it when
          it is untrue to its own inner forces.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has it when it is at peace with itself; and lacks it when
          it is at war with itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          You already know this quality. The feeling for it is the most
          primitive feeling which an animal or a man can have.
          The feeling for it is as primitive as the feeling for
          our own well-being, for our own health, as primitive
          as the intuition which tells us when something is false
          or true.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to grasp it fully you must overcome the prejudice of physics
          which tells us that all tilings are equally alive and
          real.

        <p>
          In physics and chemistry there is no sense in which one system
          can be more at one with itself than another.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          And no sense at all in which what a system "ought to be" grows
          naturally from "what it is." Take, for example, the
          atoms which a physicist deals with. An atom is so simple
          that there is never any question whether it is true
          to its own nature. Atoms are all true to their own
          natures; they are all equally real; they simply exist.
          An atom cannot be more true to itself, or less true
          to itself. And because physics has concentrated on
          very simple systems, like atoms, we have been led to
          believe that what something "is," is an entirely separate
          question from what it "ought to be"; and that science
          and ethics can't be mixed.
        </p>

    <div class="unit">
      <div class="unit-headline">
        <p>
          But the view of the world which physics teaches, powerful and
          wonderful as it is, is limited by this very blindness.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          In the world of complex systems it is not so. Most men are not
          fully true to their own inner natures or fully "real."
          In fact, for many people, the effort to become true
          to themselves is the central problem of life. When
          you meet a person who is true to himself, you feel
          at once that he is "more real" than other people are.
          At the human level of complexity, then, there is a
          distinction between systems which are true to their
          "inner nature," and those which aren't. Not all of
          us are equally true to our inner nature, or equally
          real, or equally whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          And exactly the same is true in those larger systems, outside
          us, which we call our world. Not all parts of the world
          are equally true to themselves, equally real, equally
          whole. In the world of physics, any system which is
          self-destroying simply ceases to exist. But in the
          world of complex systems this is not so.

    <div class="unit">
      <div class="unit-headline">
        <p>
          Indeed, this subtle and complex freedom from inner contradictions
          is just the very quality which makes things live.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          In the world of living things, every system can be more real
          or less real, more true to itself or less true to itself.
          It cannot become more true to itself by copying any
          externally imposed criterion of what it ought to be.
          But it is possible to define a process which will tell
          you how the system can become more true to itself,
          in short what it "ought to be," only according to what
          it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          This oneness, or the lack of it, is the fundamental quality for
          any thing. Whether it is in a poem, or a man, or in
          a building full of people, or in a forest, or a city,
          everything that matters stems from it. It embodies
          everything.

        <p>
          The fact that this quality cannot be named does not mean that
          it is vague or imprecise. It is impossible to name
          because it is unerringly precise. Words fail to capture
          it because it is much more precise than any word. The
          quality itself is sharp, exact, with no looseness in
          it whatsoever. But each word you choose to capture
          it has fuzzy edges and extensions which blur the central
          meaning of the quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall try to show you now, why words can never capture it,

          There is a sense in which the distinction between something alive
          and something lifeless is much more general, and far
          more profound, than the distinction between living
          things and nonliving things, or between life and death.
          Things which are living may be lifeless; nonliving
          things may be alive. A man who is walking and talking
          can be alive; or he can be lifeless. Beethoven's last
          quartets are alive; so are the waves at the ocean shore;
          so is a candle flame; a tiger may be more alive, because
          more in tune with its own inner forces, than a man.

          A well-made fire is alive. There is a world of difference between
          a fire which is a pile of burning logs, and a fire
          which is made by someone who really understands a fire.
          He places each log exactly to make the air between
          the logs just right. He doesn't stir the logs with
          a poker, but while they are burning, grasps each one,
          and places it again, perhaps only an inch from where
          it was before. The logs are so exactly placed that
          they form channels for the draft. Waves of liquid yellow
          flame run up the logs when the draft blows. Each log
          glows with full intensity. The fire, watched, burns
          so intensely and so steadily, that when it dies, finally,
          it burns to nothing; when the last glow dies, there
          is nothing but a little dust left in the fireplace.

          The overwhelming thing that stays with you is that the fire lives.
          And yet this is a metaphor. Literally, we know that
          plants and animals are alive, and fire and music are
          not alive. If we are pressed to explain why we call
          one fire alive and another dead, then we are at a loss.
          The metaphor makes us believe that we have found a
          word to grasp the quality without a name. But we can
          only use the word to name the quality, when we already
          understand the quality.

          A thing is whole according to how free it is of inner contradictions.
          When it is at war with itself, and gives rise to forces
          which act to tear it down, it is unwhole. The more
          free it is of its own inner contradictions, the more
          whole and healthy and wholehearted it becomes.

          Compare the trees along a wild and windblown lake, with an eroded
          gully. These trees and branches are so made that when
          the wind blows they all bend, and all the forces in
          the system, even the violent forces of the wind, are
          still in balance when the trees are bent; and because
          they are in balance, they do no harm, they do no violence.
          The configuration of the bending trees makes them self-maintaining.
        </p>
        <p>
          But think about a piece of land that is very steep, and where
          erosion is taking place. There aren't enough tree roots
          to hold the earth together, let's say; the rain falls,
          in torrents, and carries the earth down streams which
          form gullies; again, the earth is still not bound together
          because there aren't enough plants there; the wind
          blows; the erosion goes further; next time the water
          comes, it runs in the very same gullies, and deepens
          them; and widens them. The configuration of this system
          is such that the forces which it gives birth to, which
          arise in it, in the long run act to destroy the system.
          The system is self-destroying; it does not have the
          capacity to contain the forces which arise within it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system of the trees and wind is whole; the system of the
          gully and the rain is unwhole.

          It suggests closure, containment, finiteness. When you call a
          thing whole, it makes you think that it is whole unto
          itself, and isolated from the world around it. But
          a lung is whole, only so long as it is breathing oxygen
          from the air outside the organism; a person is whole
          only so long as he is a member of some human group;
          a town is whole only so long as it is in balance with
          the surrounding countryside.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word carries a subtle hint of self-containment. And self-containment
          always undermines the quality which has no name. For
          this reason, the word "whole" can never perfectly describe
          this quality.

          Another facet of the quality which has no name is caught by the

          The word "comfortable" is more profound than people usually realize.
          The mystery of genuine comfort goes far beyond the
          simple idea that the word first seems to mean. Places
          which are comfortable are comfortable because they
          have no inner contradictions, because there is no little
          restlessness disturbing them.

          Imagine yourself on a winter afternoon with a pot of tea, a book,
          a reading light, and two or three huge pillows to lean
          back against. Now make yourself comfortable. Not in
          some way which you can show to other people, and say
          how much you like it. I mean so that you <i>really</i>          like it, for <i>yourself</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You put the tea where you can reach it: but in a place where
          you can't possibly knock it over. You pull the light
          down, to shine on the book, but not too brightly, and
          so that you can't see the naked bulb. You put the cushions
          behind you, and place them, carefully, one by one,
          just where you want them, to support your back, your
          neck, your arm: so that you are supported just comfortably,
          just as you want to sip your tea, and read, and dream.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you take the trouble to do all that, and you do it carefully,
          with much attention, then it may begin to have the
          quality which has no name.

          Think of a truck, filled with bags of cement. If the bags are
          stacked perfectly, in lines, it may be careful, and
          intelligent, and quite precise. But it will not begin
          to have the quality without a name, until there is
          a certain freedom there: the men who piled the bags,
          running, and throwing them, forgetting themselves,

          is borrowed, artificial, forced, contrived, made to
          copy outside images, not generated by the forces inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          That kind of so-called freedom is opposite to the quality which
          has no name.

          A word which helps restore the balance is the word "exact."

          The word "exact" helps to counterbalance the impression of other
          words like "comfortable" and "free." These words suggest
          that the quality without a name is somehow inexact.
          And it is true that it is loose and fluid and relaxed.
          But it is never inexact. The forces in a situation
          are real forces. There is no getting round them. If
          the adaptation to the forces is not perfectly exact,
          there can be no comfort, and no freedom, because the
          small forces which have been left out will always work
          to make the system fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose that I am trying to make a table for the blackbirds in
          my garden. In winter, when the snow is on the ground,
          and the blackbirds are short of food, I will put food
          out for them on the table. So I build the table; and
          dream about the clusters of blackbirds which will come
          flocking to the table in the snow.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is not so easy to build a table that will really work.
          The birds follow their own laws; and if I don't understand
          them, they just won't come. If I put the table too
          low, the birds won't fly down to it, because they don't
          like to swoop too close to the ground. If it is too
          high in the air, or too exposed, the wind won't let
          them settle on it. If it is near a laundry line, blowing
          in the wind, they will be frightened by the moving
          line. Most of the places where I put the table actually
          don't work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I slowly learn that blackbirds have a million subtle forces guiding
          them in their behavior. If I don't understand these
          forces, there is simply nothing I can do to make the
          table come to life. So long as the placing of the table
          is inexact, my image of the blackbirds flocked around
          the table eating, is just wishful thinking. To make
          the table live, I must take these forces seriously,
          and place the table in a position which is perfectly
          exact.

    <div class="unit">

          And, yet, of course, the word "exact" does not describe it properly.

      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          It has no sense of freedom in it; and it is too reminiscent of
          those other things which are exact in an entirely different
          sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usually, when we say something is exact, we mean that it fits
          some abstract image perfectly. If I cut a square of
          cardboard, and make it perfectly exact, it means that
          I have made the cardboard perfectly square : its sides
          are exactly equal: and its angles are exactly ninety
          degrees. I have matched an image perfectly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The meaning of the word "exact" which I use here is almost opposite.
          A thing which has the quality without a name never
          fits any image exactly. What is exact is its adaptation
          to the forces which are in it. But this exactness requires
          that it be loose and fluid in its form.

          A word which goes much deeper than the word "exact" is "egoless"

          When a place is lifeless or unreal, there is almost always a
          mastermind behind it. It is so filled with the will
          of its maker that there is no room for its own nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think, by contrast, of the decoration on an old bench —small
          hearts carved in it; simple holes, cut out while it
          was being put together—these can be egoless.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are not carved according to some plan. They are carefree,
          carved into it, wherever there seems to be a gap. It
          is not in the least contrived; there is no effort in
          the decoration; it does not seek to express the personality
          of the man who carved it. It is so natural, that it
          almost seems as though the bench itself cried out for
          it: and the carver simply did what was required.

    <div class="unit">
      <div class="unit-headline">
        <p>
          And yet although the old bench and its carving may be egoless
          this word is also not quite right.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          It does not mean, for instance, that the man who made it left
          his own person out of it. It was part of his person
          that he liked the bench, and wanted to carve hearts
          in it. Perhaps he made it for his favorite girl.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is perfectly possible to make a thing which has the quality
          which has no name, and still let it reflect your personality.
          Your person, and the likes and dislikes which are part
          of you, are themselves forces in your garden, and your
          garden must reflect those forces just as it reflects
          the other forces which make leaves grow and birds sing.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if you use the word "ego'' to mean the center of a person's
          character, then the idea of making something egoless
          can sound as though you want the person to efface himself
          completely. That is not what the word means at all;
          and yet because of it, the word is not quite right.

          Some are eternal in almost a literal sense: they are so strong,
          so balanced, so strongly self-maintaining, that they
          are not easily disturbed, almost imperishable. Others
          reach the quality for no more than an instant, and

          rule.

          The word "eternal" describes them both. For the instant that
          they have this quality, they reach into the realm of
          eternal truth. At that moment when they are free from
          inner contradictions, they take their place among the
          order of things which stand outside of time.

          A farmer made it for his farm. The pond was a simple rectangle,
          about 6 feet wide, and 8 feet long; opening off a little
          irrigation stream. At one end, a bush of flowers hung
          over the water. At the other end, under the water,
          was a circle of wood, its top perhaps 12 inches below
          the surface of the water. In the pond there were eight
          great ancient carp, each maybe 18 inches long, orange,
          gold, purple, and black: the oldest one had been there
          eighty years. The eight fish swam, slowly, slowly,
          in circles—often within the wooden circle. The whole
          world was in that pond. Every day the farmer sat by
          it for a few minutes. I was there only one day and
          I sat by it all afternoon. Even now, I cannot think
          of it without tears. Those ancient fish had been swimming,
          slowly, in that pond for eighty years. It was so true
          to the nature of the fish, and flowers, and the water,
          and the farmers, that it had sustained itself for all
          that time, endlessly repeating, always different. There
          is no degree of wholeness or reality which can be reached
          beyond that simple pond.

          above all ordinary. What makes it eternal is its ordinariness.

          other meanings, which are distant from this point.

          Since every word is always an ellipse like this—then every word
          will always be too broad, too vague, too large in scope
          to refer only and exactly to the quality which is the
          point. No word can ever catch the quality without a
          name because the quality is too particular, and words
          too broad. And yet it is the most important quality

        <p> It is when all our forces can move freely in us. In nature,
          this quality is almost automatic, because there are
          no images to interfere with natural processes of making
          things. But in all of our creations, the possibility
          occurs that images can interfere with the natural,
          necessary order of a thing. And, most of all, this
          way that images distort the things we make, is familiar
          in ourselves. For we ourselves are, like our works,
          the products of our own creation. And we are only free,

          just exactly what one is, of letting the forces flow
          freely; of letting the configuration of one's person
          adjust truly to these forces.
        </p>
        <p> Our letting go is stifled, all the time, so long as we
          have ideas and opinions about ourselves, which make
          us hug too tightly to our images of how to live, and
          bottle up these forces.

        <p>
          So long as we are still bottled up, like this, there is a tightness

          and a brittleness in the way we walk, the way we move.

          And yet, until one does let go, it is impossible to be alive.
          The stereotypes are restricted; there are very different
          configurations. The infinite variety of actual people,
          with their vastly and utterly different forces, require
          a huge creation, to find the resolution of the person:
          and in finding this resolution truly, one must above
          all be free of the stereotypes.

          The wind, the soft rain; sitting on the back of an old truck
          moving clothes and baskets of possessions while the
          gentle rain is falling, laughing, crouching under a
          shawl to keep from getting wet, but getting wet. Eating
          a loaf of bread, torn in pieces, hunks of cheese cut
          crudely with a hatchet which is lying in the corner;
          red flowers glistening in the rain along the roadside;
          banging on the window of the truck to shout some joke.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing to keep, nothing to lose. No possessions, no security,
          no concern about possessions, and no concern about
          security: in this mood it is possible to do exactly
          what makes sense, and nothing else: there are no hidden
          fears, no morals, no rules, no undercurrent of constraint,
          no subtle sense of concern for the form of what the
          people round about you are doing, and above all no
          concern for what you are yourself, no subtle fear of
          other people's ridicule, no subtle train of fears which
          can connect the smallest triviality with bankruptcy
          and loss of love and loss of friends and death, no
          ties, no suits, no outward elements of majesty at all.

          forces show themselves; whatever you are doing at such
          a moment, hold on to it, repeat it for that certain

          something late at night over a table with a group of

          earnest concentration.

          We can identify the towns and buildings, streets and gardens,
          flower beds, chairs, tables, tablecloths, wine bottles,
          garden seats, and kitchen sinks which have this quality—simply
          by asking whether they are like us when we are free.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need only ask ourselves which places—which towns, which buildings,
          which rooms, have made us feel like this—which of them
          have that breath of sudden passion in them, which whispers
          to us, and lets us recall those moments when we were

          And the connection between the two—between this quality in our

          not just an analogy, or similarity. The fact is that

          tend to make it come to life in towns and buildings
          which we help to build. It is a self-supporting, self-maintaining,
          generating quality. It is the quality of life. And
          we must seek it, for our own sakes, in our surroundings,
          simply in order that we can ourselves become alive.

      Patterns of events

    <div class="chapter-headline">
      In order to define this quality in buildings and in towns, we
      must begin by understanding that every place is given its
      character by certain patterns of events that keep on happening
      there.

          We know what the quality without a name is like in our own lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we shall see in the next few chapters, this quality can only
          come to life in us when it exists within the world
          that we are fart of. We can come alive only to the
          extent the buildings and towns we live in are alive.
          The quality without a name is circular: it exists in
          us, when it exists in our buildings; and it only exists
          in our buildings, when we have it in ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand this clearly, we must first recognize that what
          a town or building is, is governed, above all, by what
          is happening there.

          The character of a place, then, is given to it by the episodes

          Those of us who are concerned with buildings tend to forget too
          easily that all the life and soul of a place, all of
          our experiences there, defend not simply on the physical
          environment, but on the patterns of events which we
          experience there.

          What is Lima—what is most memorable there—eating anticuchos in
          the street; small pieces of beef heart, on sticks,
          cooked over open coals, with hot sauce on them; the
          dark, badly lit night streets of Lima, small carts
          with the flickering fire of the hot coals, the faces
          of the sellers, shadowy figures gathered round, to
          eat the beef hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or in Geneva—chestnuts, hot, in small paper bags, eaten in the
          autumn mist, warming the fingers.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, what is it about the California coast—the shock of the waves,
          the hiss of the surf, standing on a rock while the
          white water hisses in, runs out, a dash across the
          wet sand to the rock, before the sea comes in again.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it is just the same indoors. Think of a big room, vast, huge
          windows, big empty fireplace, completely empty, no
          furniture at all, except an easel and a chair Picasso's
          studio. Is this not made entirely of the situations,
          the forces let loose by the configuration of events?

        <p>
          And what of a party around a kitchen table, people drinking together,
          cooking together, drinking wine, eating grapes, together
          preparing a stew of beef and wine and garlic and tomatoes
          which takes four hours to cook and while it cooks,
          we drink, and then, at last we eat it.

        <p>
          What of the kind of moment we remember most of all: the flickering
          candles on the Christmas tree, the small bell ringing,
          the children waiting, hour by hour, outside the door,
          peeping through the crack, and finally rushing in,
          when they hear the tinkling of that small bell, and
          see the tree there, lit, with fifty white and red candles,
          burning, and the smell of singed pine needles where
          a twig caught fire while the candles were being lit.
        </p>
        <p>
          What of the process of scrubbing the floor, working the stiff
          bristles of the brush, and the pail of water, over
          the soft boards, with fibers breaking loose, and the
          smell of the soap that stays in the wood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or saying goodbye, at a train, leaning through the window of
          the train, waving, kissing, as the train pulls out,
          running along the platform. &hellip;
        </p>
        <p>
          Or, taking the Sunday walk, a family, abreast, in twos and threes,
          walking along the road, pushing the smallest child
          perhaps, the others lagging behind to look at frogs,
          and an old shoe.

          It is the action of these moments, the people involved in them,

        <p>
          The life of a house, or of a town, is not given to it, directly,
          by the shape of its buildings, or by the ornament and
          plan—it is given to them by the quality of the events
          and situations we encounter there. Always it is our
          situations which allow us to be what we are.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the people around us, and the most common ways we have
          of meeting them, of being with them, it is, in short,
          the ways of being which exist in our world, that make
          it possible for us to be alive.

    <div class="unit">

          We know, then, that what matters in a building or a town is not
          its outward shape, its physical geometry alone, but
          the events that happen there.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          It is all the events which happen there—the human events given
          by the situations which are repeated, the mechanical
          events, the rush of trains, the fall of water, the
          slow cracking of structures, the growing of the grass,
          the melting of the snow, the rusting of iron, the flowering
          of roses, the heat of a summer's day, the cooking,
          loving, playing, dying, and not only of ourselves,
          but of the animals, and plants, and even of the inorganic
          processes which make the whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, some events happen once in a lifetime; others happen
          more often; and some happen very often indeed. But
          although it is true that a unique event can sometimes
          change our lives completely, or leave its mark on us,
          it is not too much to say that, by and large, the overall
          character of our lives is given by those events which
          keep on recurring over and over again.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, by the same token, it is roughly true that any system, any
          aspect of the life of a part of the world, is essentially
          governed by those situations, human or nonhuman—which
          keep on repeating there.

          eat at a restaurant, having a drink at a friend's house,
          driving on the freeway, going to bed again. There are
          a few more.

          There are surprisingly few of these patterns of events in any
          one person's way of life, perhaps no more than a dozen.
          Look at your own life and you will find the same. It
          is shocking at first, to see that there are so few
          patterns of events open to me.

          Not that I want more of them. But when I see how very few of
          them there are, I begin to understand what huge effect
          these few patterns have on my life, on my capacity
          to live. If these few patterns are good for me, I can
          live well. If they are bad for me, I can't.

          For a teenage boy, at high school in Los Angeles, his situations
          include hanging out in the corridor with other boys;
          watching television; sitting in a car with his girlfriend
          at a drive-in restaurant eating coke and hamburgers.
          For an old woman, in a European mountain village, her

          change them almost wholly. But it is not possible to

          We have a glimpse, then, of the fact that our world has a structure,

          This does not mean that sface creates events, or that it causes

        <p>
          For example, in a modern town, the concrete spatial pattern of
          a sidewalk does not "cause" the kinds of human behavior
          which happens there.
        </p>
        <p>
          What happens is much more complex. The people on the sidewalk,
          being culture-bound, know that the space which they
          are part of is a sidewalk, and, as part of their culture,
          they have the pattern of a sidewalk in their minds.
          It is this pattern in their minds which causes them
          to behave the way that people do behave on sidewalks,
          not the purely spatial aspect of the concrete and the
          walls and curbs.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this means, of course, that in two cultures, people may see
          sidewalks differently, that is, they may have different
          patterns in their minds—and, that they will, as a result,
          act differently on the sidewalks. For example, in New
          York, a sidewalk is mainly a place for walking, jostling,
          moving fast. And by comparison, in Jamaica, or India,
          a sidewalk is a place to sit, to talk, perhaps to play
          music, even to sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not correct to interpret this by saying that the two sidewalks
          are the same.

    </div>
    <div class="unit">
      <div class="unit-headline">
        <p>
          It simply means that a pattern of events cannot be separated
          from the space where it occurs.

      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">

          Each sidewalk is a unitary system, which includes <i>both</i>          the field of geometrical relationships which define
          its concrete geometry, and the field of human actions
          and events, which are associated with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          So when we see that a sidewalk in Bombay is used by people sleeping,
          or for parking cars &hellip; and that in New York it
          is used only for walking—we cannot interpret this correctly
          as a single sidewalk pattern, with two different uses.
          The Bombay sidewalk (space + events) is one pattern;
          the New York sidewalk (space + events) is another pattern.
          They are two entirely different patterns.

          We do not separate the stream bed from the stream. There is no
          distinction in our minds between the bed of the stream,
          its banks, its winding configuration in the land, and
          the rushing of the water, the growth of plants, the

          Each one is a living thing, a pattern of events in space, just

          which happens, over and again, and is exactly one of
          the elements from which the world is made.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it is therefore clear that we can only understand these patterns

          themselves.

          It is the space itself which lives and breathes; it is the space
          which is the walking, jostling sidewalk in New York;

          a collection of interacting, and adjacent, patterns
          of events in space, each one repeating certain events
          over and over again, yet always anchored by its place

          We are now ready to come to grips with the most basic problem
          of a building or a town: What is it made of? What is
          its structure? What is its physical essence? What are
          the building blocks of which its space is made?
        </p>
        <p>
          We know, from chapter 4, that any town and any building gets
          its character from those events and patterns of events
          which keep on happening there the most, and that the
          patterns of events are linked, somehow, to space.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, though, we do not know just what aspect of the space
          it is that correlates with the events. We do not have
          a picture of a building or a town which shows us how
          its obvious outward structure—the way it looks, its
          physical geometry—is interlocked with these events.

        <p>
          It means, of course, that I want to make a simple picture of
          it, which lets me grasp it as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it means, too, that as far as possible, I want to paint this
          simple picture out of as few elements as possible.
          The fewer elements there are, the richer the relationships
          between them, and the more of the picture lies in the
          "structure" of these relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          And finally, of course, I want to paint a picture which allows
          me to understand the patterns of events which keep
          on happening in the thing whose structure I seek. In
          other words, I hope to find a picture, or a structure,
          which will, in some rather obvious and simple sense,
          account for the outward properties, for the pattern
          of events of the thing which I am studying.

          What is the relation between a church, say, taken as an element—and
          the pattern of events which happens in the church?
          It is all very well to say that they are connected.
          But unless we can see some kind of common sense in
          the connection, it explains nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is certainly not enough merely to say glibly that every pattern
          of events resides in space. That is obvious, and not
          very interesting. What we want to know is just how
          the structure of the space supports the patterns of
          events it does, in such a way that if we change the
          structure of the space, we shall be able to predict
          what kinds of changes in the patterns of events this
          change will generate.
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, we want a theory which presents the interaction of
          the space and the events, in a clear and unambiguous
          way.

          Further, it is very puzzling to realize that the "elements,"
          which seem like elementary building blocks, keep varying,

          For among the endless repetition of elements we also see an almost
          endless variation. Each church has a slightly different
          nave, the aisles are different, the west door is different
          &hellip; and in the nave, the various bays are usually
          different, the individual columns are different; each
          vault has slightly different ribs; each window has
          a slightly different tracery and different glass.
        </p>
        <p>
          And just so in an urban region. Each industrial area is different;
          each freeway is different; each park is different;
          each supermarket is different—even the smaller individual
          elements like traffic lights and stop signs, although
          very similar, are never quite the same—and there is
          always a variety of types.

          If the elements are different every time that they occur evidently
          then it cannot be the elements themselves which are
          repeating in a building or a town: these so-called
          elements cannot be the ultimate "atomic" constituents

          Since every church is different, the so-called element we call
          "church" is not constant at all. Giving it a name only
          deepens the puzzle. If every church is different, what
          is it that remains the same, from church to church,
          that we call "church"?

          When we say that matter is made of electrons, protons, and so
          forth, this is a satisfying way of understanding things,
          because these electrons seem, indeed, to be the same
          each time that they occur, and it therefore makes sense
          to show how matter can be built up from combinations
          of these "elements," because the elements are truly
          elementary.

          But if the so-called elements of which a building or a town is
          made—the houses, streets, windows, doors—are merely
          names, and the underlying things which they refer to
          keep on changing, then we have no solidity at all in
          our picture, and we need to find some other elements
          which truly are invariant throughout the variation,
          in a way that we can understand a building or a town
          as a structure made up by combination of these elements.

          In a gothic cathedral, the nave is <i>flanked by</i>          aisles which run parallel to it. The transept is at
          <i>right angles</i> to the nave and aisles; the ambulatory
          is <i>wrapped around</i> the outside of the apse; the
          columns are <i>vertical,
          on the line separating</i> nave from aisle, <i>spaced at equal
          intervals</i>. Each vault connects <i>four</i> columns,
          and has a characteristic shape, <i>cross-like</i> in
          plan, <i>concave</i> in space. The buttresses are run
          down the outside of the aisles, on the same lines as
          the columns, supporting the load from the vaults. The
          nave is always a <i>long
          thin rectangle</i>—its <i>ratio may vary between 1:3 and 1:6,
          but is never 1:2 or 1:20</i>. The aisles are always

          Consider a typical mid-twentieth-century American metropolitan
          region. Somewhere <i>towards the center</i>          of the region, there is a central business district,
          which contains a <i>very high density</i> office block;
          near these there are <i>high density</i> apartments.
          The overall density of the region <i>slopes off with distance from the center,
          according to an exponential law periodically there
          are again peaks</i> of higher density, but smaller
          than the central ones; and <i>subsidiary</i> to these
          <i>smaller</i> peaks, there are still smaller peaks.
          Each of these peaks of density <i>contains</i> stores
          and offices <i>surrounded by</i> higher density housing.
          <i>Towards the outer fringe</i> of the metropolis there
          are <i>large</i> areas of <i>freestanding</i> one-family
          houses; <i>the farther out from the center
          they are, the larger</i> their gardens. The region
          is served by a <i>network</i> of freeways. These freeways
          are <i>closer together</i> at the center. Independent
          of the freeways, there is a <i>roughly regular two-dimensional network</i>          of streets. <i>Every five or ten</i> streets, there
          is a larger one, which functions as an artery. A few
          of the arteries are even bigger than the others: these
          tend to be arranged
          <i>radially, branching out</i> from the center in a
          <i>star-shaped
          fashion</i>. Where an artery meets a freeway,
          there is a characteristic <i>cloverleaf arrangement of connecting
          lanes</i>. <i>Where</i> two arteries <i>intersect</i>          there is a traffic light; <i>where</i> a local street
          <i>meets</i> an artery, there is a stop sign. The major
          commercial areas, which <i>coincide
          with</i> the high density peaks in the density distribution,
          all fall on the major arteries. Industrial areas all
          fall <i>within half a mile</i> of a freeway and the
          older ones are also <i>close to</i> at least one major
          artery.

          Think of the aisle of the cathedral. It is parallel to the nave,
          and next to it, it shares columns with the nave, it
          runs east-west, like the church itself, it contains
          columns, on its inner wall, and windows on its outer
          wall. At first sight, it seems that these relationships
          are "extra," over and above the fact of its being an
          aisle.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="unit">
      <div class="unit-headline">
        <p>
          When we look closer, we realize that these relationships are
          not extra, but necessary to the elements, indeed a
          part of them.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          We realize, for instance, that if an aisle were not parallel
          to the nave, were not next to it, were not narrower
          than the nave, did not share columns with the nave,
          did not run east to west, &hellip; that it would not
          be an "aisle" at all. It would be merely a rectangle
          of space, in gothic construction, floating free &hellip;
          and what makes it an aisle, specifically, is just the
          pattern of relationships which it has to the nave,
          and other elements around it.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="unit">
      <div class="unit-headline">
        <p>
          When we look closer still, we realize that even this view is
          still not very accurate. For it is not merely true
          that the relationships are attached to the elements:
          the fact is that the elements themselves are patterns
          of relationships.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          For, once we recognize that much of what we think of as an "element"
          in fact lies in the pattern of relationships between
          this thing and the things in the world around it, we
          then come to the second even greater realization, that
          the so-called element is itself nothing but a myth,
          and that indeed, the element itself is not just embedded
          in a pattern of relationships, but is itself entirely
          a pattern of relationships, and nothing else.
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, the aisle, which needs the pattern of relationships
          to the nave and the east window to define it, is itself
          also a pattern of relationships between its length,
          its width, the columns which lie on the boundary with
          the nave, the windows which lie on the outer boundary
          &hellip;

          And finally, the things which seem like elements dissolve, and
          leave a fabric of relationships behind, which is the
          stuff that actually repeats itself, and gives the structure
          to a building or a town.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          In short, we may forget about the idea that the building is made
          up of elements entirely, and recognize instead, the
          deeper fact that all these so-called elements are only
          labels for the patterns of relationships which really
          do repeat.
        </p>
        <p>
          The freeway, as a whole, does not repeat. But the fact that there
          are cloverleafs which connect the freeway to roads
          at certain intervals—that <i>does</i> repeat.
          There is a certain relationship between the freeway
          and its crossing arteries and cloverleafs, which does
          repeat.
        </p>
        <p>
          But once again, the cloverleaf <i>itself</i> does not
          repeat. Each cloverleaf is different. What does repeat
          is that each lane forms a continuously curving off
          ramp to the right—there is a relationship between its
          radius, its tangency, the fact that it is banked, which
          does repeat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet once again the "lane" which figures in this pattern of relationships
          does not repeat. What we call a lane is itself a relationship
          among still smaller so-called elements—the edges of
          the road, the surface, the lines which form the edge
          &hellip; and these again, although they function temporarily
          as elements, in order to make these relations clear,
          themselves evaporate when we look closely at them.

          Each one of these patterns is a morphological law, which establishes

            Within a context of type X, the parts A, B, &hellip; are related

          <span class='indent'>
            Within a gothic cathedral &#x2192; the nave is flanked on both
            sides by parallel aisles.

          <span class='indent'>
            Where a freeway meets an artery &#x2192; the access ramps of
            the interchange take the rough form of a cloverleaf.

          And each law or pattern is itself a pattern of relationships

          For though each pattern is itself apparently composed of smaller
          things which look like parts, of course, when we look
          closely at them, we see that these apparent "parts"
          are patterns too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider, for example, the pattern we call a door. This pattern
          is a relationship among the frame, the hinges, and
          the door itself: and these parts in turn are made of
          smaller parts: the frame is made of uprights, a crosspiece,
          and cover mouldings over joints; the door is made of
          uprights, crosspieces and panels; the hinge is made
          of leaves and a pin. Yet any one of these things we
          call its "parts" are themselves in fact also patterns,
          each one of which may take an almost infinite variety
          of shapes, and color and exact size relationships which
          make it what it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          The patterns are not just patterns of relationships, but patterns
          of relationships among other smaller patterns, which
          themselves have still other patterns hooking them together
          and we see finally, that the world is entirely made
          of all these interhooking, interlocking nonmaterial
          patterns.

          For instance, the pattern of the freeway contains a certain fabric

          speeds; there are rules governing the way that people
          may change lanes; the cars all face the same way; there
          are certain kinds of overtaking; people drive a little
          slower on the entrances and exits &hellip
        </p>
        <p>
          And the pattern of a kitchen, in any given culture, also contains
          a very definite pattern of events: the way that people
          use the kitchen, the way that food is prepared, the
          fact that people eat there, or don't eat there, the
          fact that they wash the dishes standing at the sink

          Neither does the pattern of events "cause" the pattern in the
          space. The total pattern, space and events together,
          is an element of people's culture. It is invented by
          culture, transmitted by culture, and merely anchored

          in making sure that just this pattern of events keeps
          on repeating over and over again, throughout the space,
          and that it is, therefore, one of the things which
          gives a certain building, or a certain town, its character.

          Go back, for example, to the porch of chapter 4, and the pattern
          of events we may call "sitting on the porch, watching
          the world go by.n
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          What aspect of the space is it which is connected to this pattern
          of events? Certainly it is not the whole porch, in
          its entirety: it is instead, just certain specific
          relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, in order for the pattern of events "watching the
          world go by" to happen, it is essential that the porch
          should be a little raised above the level of the street;
          it is essential that the porch be deep enough, to let
          a group of people sit there comfortably; and it is
          essential, of course, that the front of the porch be
          open, pierced with openings, and that the roof is therefore
          supported on columns.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="unit">
      <div class="unit-headline">
        <p>
          It is this bundle of relationships which is essential, because
          these are the ones which are directly congruent with
          the pattern of events.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          By contrast, the length of the porch, its height, its color,
          the materials of which it is made, the height of the
          side walls, the way the porch connects up with the
          inside of the house, are less essential—so they can
          vary, without altering the fundamental and essential
          nature of the porch.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="unit">
      <div class="unit-headline">
        <p>
          And in this same sense, each pattern of relationships in space
          is congruent with some specific pattern of events.

      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          The pattern of relationships we call a "freeway" is just that
          pattern of relationships required by the process of
          driving fast with limited access to and from side roads:
          in short the pattern of events.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pattern of relationships we call a Chinese "kitchen" is just
          that pattern of relationships required for cooking
          Chinese food: again the underlying pattern of events.
        </p>
        <p>
          And insofar as there are different "kinds" of kitchens, there
          are different patterns of relationships, responsible
          for slightly different patterns of events, in different
          cultures, which have different patterns of cooking.
        </p>
        <p>
          In every case the pattern of relationships in space is that invariant
          which must repeat itself with some pattern of events,
          because it is exactly these relationships which are
          required to sustain that pattern of events.

    <div class="unit">
      <div class="unit-headline">
        <p>
          We realize then that it is just the patterns of events in space
          which are repeating in the building or the town: and
          <i>nothing else</i>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          Nothing of any importance happens in a building or a town except
          what is defined within the patterns which repeat themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          For what the patterns do is at the same time seize the outward
          physical geometry, and also seize what happens there.
        </p>
        <p>
          They account entirely for its geometrical structure: they are
          the visible, coherent stuff that is repeating, and
          coherent there: they are the background of the variation,
          which makes each concrete element a little different.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, at the same time, they are also responsible for those events
          which keep repeating there, and therefore do the most
          to give the building or a town its character &hellip;
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="unit">
      <div class="unit-headline">
        <p>
          Each neighborhood is defined, too, in everything that matters,
          by the patterns which keep on repeating there.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          Again, it is just those details which give the neighborhood a
          "character" which are defined by patterns: the kind
          of streets which it has, the kind of lots the houses
          are; the typical size of houses, the way that the houses
          are connected or distinct. &hellip;
        </p>
        <p>
          Isn't it true that the features which you remember in a place
          are not so much peculiarities, but rather the typical,
          the recurrent, the characteristic features: the canals
          of Venice, the flat roofs of a Moroccan town, the even
          spacing of the fruit trees in an orchard, the slope
          of a beach towards the sea, the umbrellas of an Italian
          beach, the wide sidewalks, sidewalk cafes, cylindrical
          poster board-use of two-inch bricks in Georgian houses,
          the ratio of bathroom area to house area, compared
          with that typical of an American house, the use of
          flagstones—on the sidewalks. Then down to the tiniest
          details of all the special shape of English faucets,
          the kinds of handles on an English metal window, the
          shape of the insulators on a telegraph pole.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, in each case the patterns define all the typical events
          which happen there. So "London," as a way of life,
          lies there completely in these patterns which the Londoners
          create, and fill with the events that are exactly congruent
          with them.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="unit">
      <div class="unit-headline">
        <p>
          And, what is most remarkable of all, the number of the patterns
          out of which a building or a town is made is rather
          small.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="unit-details">
        <p>
          One might imagine that a building has a thousand different patterns
          in it; or that a town has tens of thousands. &hellip;
        </p>
        <p>
          But the fact is that a building is defined, in its essentials,
          by a few dozen patterns. And, a vast town like London,
          or Paris, is defined, in its essence, by a few hundred
          patterns at the most.
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, the patterns have enormous power and depth; they have
          the power to create an almost endless variety, they
          are so deep, so general, that they can combine in millions
          upon millions of different ways, to such an extent,
          that when we walk through Paris we are mainly overwhelmed
          by the variety; and the fact that there are these deep
          invariants, lying behind the vast variety, and generating
          it, is really an amazing shock. &hellip;
        </p>
        <p>
          In this sense, the patterns are perhaps still deeper and more
          powerful than the discussion has made clear so far.
          From a handful of patterns, a vast, almost incalculable
          variety can be made: and a building, with all of its
          complexity and variety, is generated, actually, by
          a small number of them.

          They are the atoms of our man-made universe.

          In chemistry we learn that the world, in all of its complexity,
          is made up from combinations of some 92 elements, or
          atoms. This is an extraordinary fact, amazing to a
          person who learns chemistry for the first time. It
          is true that our conception of these atoms has changed
          repeatedly far from being the little billiard balls
          we once thought, we know that they are shifting patterns
          of particles and waves and—that even the most "elementary"
          particle the electron not a "thing." However, all these
          changing views do not alter the fact that at the level
          of scale 'where atoms occur, they do occur, as identifiable
          recurrent entities. And even if vast changes occur
          in physics, and we one day recognize that these so-called
          atoms are also merely ripples in a deeper field, the
          fact that there are entities of some kind which correspond
          to the things we once called atoms will remain.
